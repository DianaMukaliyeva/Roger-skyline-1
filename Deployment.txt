apt-get install ssh sudo vim					//install sudo, vim and ssh package
adduser <username>								//create a new user
awk  -F : '/home/ {print $1 }' /etc/passwd 		//see all users
chmod 640 /etc/sudoers 							//to change rights to sudoers file
visudo /etc/sudoers								//add after 
																	# User privilege specification
																	root         ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
																	username     ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
exit											//exit from the root user


<<<2>>> Setup static IP and a Netmask in \30

In the settings of VM change Network-attached to from NAT  Bridged Adapter
ip a						//to see what interfaces are we have
sudo vim /etc/network/interfaces				//change this file to 
												# This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
												# and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).

												source /etc/network/interfaces.d/*

												# The loopback network interface
												auto lo
												iface lo inet loopback

												# The primary network interface
												auto enp0s3
sudo vim /etc/network/interfaces.d/enp0s3		//and put there
												iface enp0s3 inet static
													address 10.13.200.215					//I choose this address
													netmask 255.255.255.252 				// because we need a Netmask in \30. Subnet Mask: http://www.sput.nl/internet/netmask-table.html
													gateway 10.13.254.254 					//netstat -rn to see gateway or ip r | grep default
sudo rm /etc/network/interfaces.d/setup			//remove it if exists or change according to enp0s3
sudo service networking restart					//restart the network
ip a											//to see our ip


<<<3>>>Default port of the SSH service, SSH access with publickeys

sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config 														//change line 13 to <Port 50000> without # (System Ports (0-1023) this is forbidden to use, User Ports (1024-49151) this should be avoided as well, and the Dynamic and/or Private Ports (49152-65535) this range can be used)
sudo service sshd restart
ssh diana@10.13.215.215 -p 50000													//connect via ssh with this port
ssh-keygen -t rsa																	//in Mac run this command and choose something for the passphrase. It generated id_rsa: our private key, and id_rsa.pub: a public key.
ssh-copy-id -i /Users/dmukaliy/.ssh/id_rsa.pub diana@10.13.215.215 -p 50000			//The public key is automatically added in "~/.ssh/authorized_keys" on the server.
sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config														//to disable password authentication and login change line 32,37,56. It should look like this:
																	PermitRootLogin no
																	PasswordAuthentication yes
																	PubkeyAuthentication yes
sudo service sshd restart															//to restart ssh service


<<<4>>>Set the rules of firewall on server only with the services used outside the VM

sudo apt-get install ufw						//The default firewall configuration tool for Ubuntu is ufw
sudo ufw status 								//if it is inactive then run
sudo ufw enable									//if it is not enabled
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
sudo ufw allow 443								//incoming HTTPS (port 443) connections
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp							//incoming HTTP(port 80) connections
sudo ufw allow 50000/tcp						//incoming SSH connections
sudo ufw reload


<<<5>>>Setiing up a DOS (Denial Of Service Attack) protection on open ports

sudo apt-get install apache2											//install apache
sudo apt-get install fail2ban											//to install
service fail2ban status
sudo cp /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf /etc/fail2ban/jail.local				//copy will prevent changes from being overwritten if a package update provides a new default file
sudo vim /etc/fail2ban/jail.localwe should add to jail.local file 		//
	[sshd]
	enabled = true 														//it was the same
	port    = ssh 														//it was by default
	logpath = %(sshd_log)s 												//by default
	backend = %(sshd_backend)s 											//by default

					[Definition]
					failregex = ^<HOST> -.*"(GET|POST).*
					ignoreregex = 
sudo ufw reload
sudo service fail2ban restart
Can test with slowloris:
					sudo apt-get install git

					cd slowloris
					perl slowloris.py 10.13.200.215
sudo cat /var/log/fail2ban.log											//To see full list of IPs that have been blocked


<<<6>>>Setting up a protection against scans on VM’s open ports

sudo apt-get install nmap			//install nmap tool Nmap works by sending data packets on a specific target (by IP) and by interpreting the incoming packets to determine what posts are open/closed, what services are running on the scanned system, whether firewalls or filters are set up and enabled, and finally what operation system is running.
sudo nmap 10.13.200.215				//Scan using IP Address
sudo apt-get install portsentry		//PortSentry is part of the Abacus Project suite of security tools. It is a program designed to detect and respond to port scans against a target host in real-time.
									PortSentry will detect SYN/half-open, FIN, NULL, X-MAS and oddball packet stealth scans.
									PortSentry has an internal state engine to remember hosts that connected previously. This allows the setting of a trigger value to prevent false alarms and detect "random" port probing. PortSentry will report all violations to the local or remote syslog daemons indicating the system name, time of attack, 
									attacking host IP and the TCP or UDP port a connection attempt was made to. Once a scan is detected your system will turn into a blackhole and disappear from the attacker.
sudo vim /etc/default/portsentry	//change tcp and udp to atcp and aupd (advanced)
sudo vim /etc/portsentry/portsentry.conf		//Ignore Options are:
												# 0 = Do not block UDP/TCP scans
												# 1 = Block UDP/TCP scans.
												# 2 = Run external command only (KILL_RUN_CMD)
							we need to change BLOCK_UDP and BLOCK_TCP to "1"
							need to omment the current KILL_ROUTE command and uncomment <<< KILL_ROUTE="/sbin/iptables -I INPUT -s $TARGET$ -j DROP"   >>>>>
												//This will drop all packets originating from an attacker’s IP address and log future connection attempts.
							need to comment <<<< KILL_HOSTS_DENY="ALL: $TARGET$ : DENY >>>>>				//So the SSH access is not denied.
sudo service portsentry restart

<<<7>>>Stoping the services we don’t need for this project

sudo systemctl list-unit-files --type=service | grep enabled							//to see all enabled services
sudo systemctl disable bluetooth.service
sudo systemctl disable console-setup.service
sudo systemctl disable keyboard-setup.service
sudo systemctl disable syslog.service
sudo systemctl disable haveged.service
sudo systemctl disable wpa_supplicant.service


<<<8>>>Script that updates all the sources of package and logs the whole in /var/log/update_script.log, scheduled task

sudo touch /var/log/update_script.log
sudo chmod 777 /var/log/update_script.log
echo "sudo apt-get update -y >> /var/log/update_script.log" > /home/diana/update_packages.sh

sudo apt install mailutils postfix
sudo vim ~/cronmonitor.sh					//created script to monitor and send email
				#!/bin/bash

				FILE_PREV_COPY="/var/tmp/monitor_cron"

Web Part

<<<1>>>Web server

Create or copy or take some template from web an index.html						//I copied on MAC
scp -P 50000 ./roger-skyline/index.html diana@10.13.200.215:/home/diana/		// from MAC
sudo mv index.html /var/www/html/												//copy in debian  /var/www/html folder which was created with the installation of apache2


<<<2>>>Setting up a self-signed SSL on all of services
lsb_release -a												//to see version
															TLS, or transport layer security, and its predecessor SSL, which stands for secure sockets layer, are web protocols used to wrap normal traffic in a protected, encrypted wrapper.
															Using this technology, servers can send traffic safely between the server and clients without the possibility of the messages being intercepted by outside parties.
															The certificate system also assists users in verifying the identity of the sites that they are connecting with.

			<<<<<Step 1: Create the SSL Certificate:
sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/ssl/private/apache-selfsigned.key -out /etc/ssl/certs/apache-selfsigned.crt	//these options will create both a key file and a certificate
sudo openssl dhparam -out /etc/ssl/certs/dhparam.pem 2048																							//create a strong Diffie-Hellman group, which is used in negotiating Perfect Forward Secrecy with clients.

			<<<<<Step 2: Configure Apache to Use SSL:
sudo vim /etc/apache2/conf-available/ssl-params.conf																								//Create a new snippet in the /etc/apache2/conf-available directory
															SSLCipherSuite EECDH+AESGCM:EDH+AESGCM:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH
															SSLProtocol All -SSLv2 -SSLv3 -TLSv1 -TLSv1.1
															SSLHonorCipherOrder On
															# Disable preloading HSTS for now.  You can use the commented out header line that includes
															# the "preload" directive if you understand the implications.
															# Header always set Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload"
															Header always set X-Frame-Options DENY
															Header always set X-Content-Type-Options nosniff
															# Requires Apache >= 2.4
															SSLCompression off
															SSLUseStapling on
															SSLStaplingCache "shmcb:logs/stapling-cache(150000)"
															# Requires Apache >= 2.4.11
															SSLSessionTickets Off
sudo cp /etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl.conf.bak												//back up the original SSL Virtual Host file
sudo vim /etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl.conf
															ServerAdmin dmukaliy@student.hive.fi
															ServerName 10.13.200.215
															SSLCertificateFile      /etc/ssl/certs/apache-selfsigned.crt
															SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/apache-selfsigned.key
sudo vim /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf																								//need to add a Redirect directive,
															 Redirect "/" "https://10.13.200.215/"

			<<<<<Step 3 — Enabling the Changes in Apache:
sudo a2enmod ssl												//Enable mod_ssl, the Apache SSL module, and mod_headers
sudo a2enmod headers
sudo a2ensite default-ssl											// enable SSL Virtual Host with the a2ensite command
sudo a2enconf ssl-params											//need to enable ssl-params.conf file, to read in the values we’ve set
sudo apache2ctl configtest											//We should check to make sure that there are no syntax errors in our files. 
sudo systemctl restart apache2

https://10.13.200.215/
http://10.13.200.215			results are the same icon, this means that redirect worked correctly.
